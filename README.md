# React Step-by-Step

A heavily-annotated series of experimental apps as I explore the [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) framework.

## The Steps

1. [Dynamic Input Using Properties](https://github.com/billgathen/react-step-by-step/tree/master/2-dynamic-input-with-properties)
1. [Nesting Components](https://github.com/billgathen/react-step-by-step/tree/master/3-nesting-components)
1. [Using Events](https://github.com/billgathen/react-step-by-step/tree/master/4-using-events)
1. [Conditional Rendering](https://github.com/billgathen/react-step-by-step/tree/master/5-conditional-rendering)

* The [Flux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc). I went half-a-dozen explanation of Flux, but couldn't wrap my head around it. Walking through the code in this repo finally cleared it up for me.
