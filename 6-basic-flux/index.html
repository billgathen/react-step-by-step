  <!-- 

    Notice that even though we've written our code in multiple files in
    different directories, the only one we need to include in our page is
    the dist/bundle.js file our build process created.

    The "counter" and "like" divs are where our React components will install
    themselves.

    To see how data flows through a Flux app, start in app.js. The comments
    will guide you through the flow.
