  <!-- 
    Flux is the design pattern Facebook uses to handle data flow and
    interaction within a React app. Flux is event-driven and its defining
    characteristic is that data flows in one direction through the app.
    We chain events (or actions) together so things find out about the
    actions they care about and can take whatever action they need to
    as a result.

    This app will be a component that tracks "likes" on a web page,
    and we'll use Flux to let the display counter know that someone has
    clicked the "like" button.

    Flux uses CommonJS "require" statements to pull in behaviors, so we'll
    switch from "all in one file" mode to "how apps are really built" mode.
    This means we'll stop compiling our JSX in the browser: instead we'll
    add a build tool at the command-line and pre-compile before serving.
    This is much more efficient and how all production apps operate.

    In the directory that contains this file are a js dir and a dist dir.
    In the js directory you'll see another series of directories: actions,
    components, constants, dispatcher and stores. These are where we'll put
    our React/Flux app code. The dist directory is where our build step will
    put the compiled application file: bundle.js. You can see above that
    dist/bundle.js is the only script file we need to include for our app
    to load into this page.

    Ready to start?

    To see how data flows through a Flux app, start in app.js. The comments
    will guide you through the flow.

    BUILDING THE CODE YOURSELF

    If you make changes to the code, you'll need to run the build process
    to see your changes in the browser. Execute the following from the
    command-line in the directory that contains this file:

      npm install
      npm install browserify -g
      npm run build

    The 'npm install' steps only have to be run once, to gather all the
    required JavaScript packages from the NPM repository.

    If it complains it can't find npm, you need to install Node first.
    Go to http://nodejs.org for instructions.

    To see how the build process works, look in the package.json file under
    the "scripts" property. We use a tool called Browserify to pull in all
    the files and combine them into a single bundle.js file.
