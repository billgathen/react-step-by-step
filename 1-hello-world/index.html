    Now we'll write our own React code.
    To keep this as simple as possible, we're writing it
    in the html file itself, which isn't the right way for
    real apps, but we'll fix that in later versions.

    Setting type to text/jsx allows React to parse our JSX before
    trying to execute our JavaScript. The @jsx React.DOM comment
    must be the first line of any script that contains JSX code.
  -->
  <script type="text/jsx">
    /** @jsx React.DOM **/

    // React is component-based. We create our own components
    // using React.createClass. It accepts an object which must
    // at a minimum include a render method that returns the
    // widgetry React needs to render the component.
    // 
    var Hello = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        // Raw HTML in our JS? Wat?!?
        // 
        // This is JSX, React's way of letting us avoid a bunch of
        // calls to HTML-generation methods and just write something like
        // plain HTML with superpowers.
        // 
        // Instead, the JSXTransformer we included above will convert
        // the line below into those methods at the last moment.
        // 
        // As far as the browser is concerned, we wrote it that way ourselves. 
        //
        return <h1>Hello world from React!</h1>;
      }
    });

    // Now that we have a component, we need to tell React to render (aka display)
    // it on the page. React.render takes two args: the JSX for the component
    // we want displayed, followed by the DOM wrapper element where we want the
    // component inserted.
    //
    // Here we're inserting it into the document body itself, but you can use
    // document.getElementById and similar methods to grab whatever element
    // you want.
    //
    // Notice that the JSX name of our new component matches the class we
    // created above, including the capital H.
    //
    React.render(
      <Hello />,
      document.body
    );

    // If you open this file in a web browser, the JSXTransformer library
    // we included above will convert all our JSX into valid JS, then it
    // will run normally, creating the component and displaying it on the page.
    //
    // You should see "Hello world from React!" on the page.
    // Congratulations! You're running React!
